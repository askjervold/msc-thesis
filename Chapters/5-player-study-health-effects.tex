This chapter examines the survey results in the context of determining th game's effect on the physical health of its players. The questions in Table \ref{tbl:rg2-survey-questions} and their answers are the main focus of this chapter, but relevant answers to other questions are also included.

\section{Results for Change in Physical Activity}

This section presents the results for the player survey questions related to Research Questions \ref{RQ2.1}, \ref{RQ2.2} and \ref{RQ2.3}. A total of 2193 subjects responded to the questions \emph{"In an average week, how much time did you spend on physical activities (e.g. walking, running or biking) before you started playing Pokémon Go?"} and \emph{"In an average week, how much time do you spend on physical activities since you started playing Pokémon Go?"}. Table \ref{tbl:physical-activity-before-and-after} shows the number of responses to each question (column 2 and 3 respectively), as well as the change \todo{(should it say delta?)}, within each time category. Percentages for the \emph{Before} and \emph{After} columns are the percentage of total respondents for the respective category, while the percentage in the \emph{Change} column shows the relative increase or decrease (negative percentages) for that category. Note that the percentages are rounded to the closest integer, and due to rounding errors, the percentages in column 2 and 3 sum to 101 \% and 99 \% respectively.

Respondents were also asked what activities lead to the increase in their physical activity, if they had become more physically active. Table \ref{tbl:physical-activity-sources} shows the number of respondents for each activity out of 1828 respondents who had an increase in physical activity.
