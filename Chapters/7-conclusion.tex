\chapter{Conclusion}
\todo{This chapter should contain the conclusion, which is a summary of the findings and what has been written in the paper.}

Not surprisingly, the results from the survey indicate that the success of Pokémon GO largely comes from the combination of a Pokémon game on smart phones for availability and nostalgia, and a game that encouraged players to go outside and explore during summer. \todo{More summary of success factors}

\todo{Physical health summary - some risks (especially playing and driving), but large increase in physical activity. Too bad it dropped off when players stopped playing. Only 19 \% left in low activity!}

\todo{Mental health summary - some disappointment and negative behavior, but overall an improvement to mental conditions, pushing sufferers to leave their safe spaces and get both exercise and interaction with others. Also great for making friends and improving relationships!}


\chapter{Future Work}
