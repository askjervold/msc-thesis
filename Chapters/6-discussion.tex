\section{Reflection on Results}

\todo{This section should reflect on the results, and explain any choices or mistakes in the process that may have negatively affected the collection of results. Could also include personal speculation on the answers.}

While the survey managed to bring in large amounts of data, some choices made while constructing the survey may have negatively affected the results.

When asking about the gender of the respondent, there were only two options: male or female. In modern society, people are becoming increasingly aware of how they wish to describe themselves, and many feel they do not fit into the binary division of genders into male and female. The question originally had an option for "Other", but it was revised before the distribution of the survey. The decision to limit the question to two options was made based on the desire to keep the results as clear as possible, and a belief that the number of potential respondents who would choose the third option was too small compared to the other two groups to be statistically significant. However, the choice may have caused some players with valuable feedback and important stories to tell to not respond at all, which may be a bigger cost than what was gained from making the choice.

The majority of the survey responses were collected from members of Pokémon GO Facebook groups and internet forums, who are likely to be more dedicated to and immersed in the game than the average player. The unfortunate consequence of this is that the results gathered don't necessarily reflect the average use of the game. This was attempted counteracted by approaching players "in the wild", but this unfortunately did not yield too many responses.
