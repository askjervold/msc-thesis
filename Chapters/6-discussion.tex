\section{Problems and Risks of Survey}

While the survey managed to bring in large amounts of data, some choices made while constructing the survey may have negatively affected the results.

\subsection{Collection of Results}

There were several issues with the distribution and some of the questions that may have impacted the number and type of responses collected.

When asking about the gender of the respondent, there were only two options: male or female. In modern society, people are becoming increasingly aware of how they wish to describe themselves, and many feel they do not fit into the binary division of genders into male and female. The question originally had an option for "Other", but it was revised before the distribution of the survey. The decision to limit the question to two options was made based on the desire to keep the results as clear as possible, and a belief that the number of potential respondents who would choose the third option was too small compared to the other two groups to be statistically significant. However, the choice may have caused some players with valuable feedback and important stories to tell to not respond at all, which may be a bigger cost than what was gained from making the choice.

The majority of the survey responses were collected from members of Pokémon GO Facebook groups and internet forums, who are likely to be more dedicated to and immersed in the game than the average player. The unfortunate consequence of this is that the results gathered don't necessarily reflect the average use of the game. This was attempted counteracted by approaching players "in the wild", but this unfortunately did not yield too many responses.

Because the actual URL for the survey was quite long and difficult to enter into a web browser, when players were approached and asked to answer the survey, the link on the note they were handed was shortened using a link shortener. While this made the URL much easier to enter into their browser, some people are skeptical of link shorteners as they do not know where they lead. This may have been a contributing factor to the low number of responses yielded from real world encounters. Sharing the direct link to the survey would most likely not have been more successful, but using Google's own link shortener may have helped. It seems surveys in the field are better performed live as interviews rather than by asking subjects to go to a web address later and answer a long survey.

The survey contained 46 questions, a relatively large number, most of which were mandatory. This may have scared away some number of respondents, and again it is likely that those who decided to answer despite the length of the survey were more dedicated to the game than those who were scared away because of it, further increasing the level of dedication of the average respondent.

A few moves were made to attempt to reduce the impact of the survey being long. First, the questions were split across several pages, grouped together by the theme of the questions. Secondly, questions deemed less important were made optional. Finally, respondents were informed that the survey was long, but that any answers they could provide would be of great help, and that they didn't have to write a lot for each question. It is impossible to know how these choices affected the responses received, and some of them may have worked against their purpose.

After some of the first responses and several comments on the length of the survey and the number of mandatory questions, some more questions were made optional. Not all the questions that were asked were used in the analysis of the results, and in retrospect probably should not have been on the survey at all. Particularly the collection of responses "in the wild" would likely have been more successful with a shorter survey. \todo{Not happy about the way this and the previous two paragraphs were written. Consider rewriting them?}

\subsection{Accuracy of Results}

There were also some issues with the questions that may have affected the accuracy of the collected data.

One question asked whether respondents would keep playing when winter came and the weather got cold. However, as the survey was distributed globally, the question failed to take into account those respondents who lived in warmer climates. For some respondents, the weather during summer was actually too warm to play outside for extended periods of time, and they were looking forward to cooler weather so they could go hunting for Pokémon on the same scale as others had been doing during the summer.

Several of the questions asked about time spent on miscellaneous activities, providing options of ranges such as \emph{2 hours or less}, \emph{4 hours or less}, \emph{8 hours or less} and so on. The goal was to make it easier for respondents to reply with estimates rather than having to figure out the exact amount of time they spend on the activity. A secondary goal was to create groupings of similar answers ahead of time.

This choice had two side-effects, however. The first issue was that the larger options such as \emph{20 hours or less} were valid answers even for those who played only an hour and a half, as 20 hours or less does indeed also include the same amounts that all the smaller options do, even though \emph{2 hours or less} would be the preferred response in this case. During construction of the survey, an alternative version of the options was considered, with options such as \emph{Between 1 and 2 hours}, \emph{Between 2 and 4 hours} and so on. However, it was believed that it was more likely that respondents would be confused by this type of alternative, as a play time of two hours could go in either of these categories, and expected that most respondents would understand to use the smaller alternative if more than one fit their answer. To further increase the odds of subjects choosing the correct option, each of these questions was annotated with \emph{"Please choose the smallest alternative that fits"}.

While it was expected that most respondents would choose the most accurate option, there was another issue with the supplied options. The ranges became wider the longer periods of time they were concerned with. The reason for this was to better capture the differences in low activity groups, and an idea that the difference between 15 and 18 hours of activity was much less significant than the difference between 30 minutes and 2 hours. This resulted in low accuracy for the larger ranges, particularly for the \emph{More than 20 hours} option, which was chosen as a cutoff to avoid too many options. On the question regarding physical activity after Pokémon GO, 67 subjects responded that they were active more than 20 hours per week after they started playing, as opposed to only 11 before. Because of the large number of subjects who increased their activity to this level (a 500 \% increase), it could have been useful to further differentiate ranges within this range. \todo{Might want to check this paragraph for coherency later.}
