\chapter{Player Study - Success Factors}

This chapter examines the survey results in the context of determining the success factors of the game. The questions in table \ref{tbl:rg1-survey-questions} and their answers are the main focus of this chapter, but relevant answers to other questions are also included.

\subsection{Results}

To answer research question \ref{RQ1.1}, subjects were asked \emph{"Which of the following factors influenced your decision to start playing Pokémon GO?"}. Table \ref{tbl:initial-interest-options} shows the options that were supplied, as well as the number of respondents for each alternative. Subjects could choose more than one option, and the \emph{Other} choice allowed the respondent to describe other reasons.

The \emph{Pokémon} category are respondents who said they started playing simply because it was Pokémon. They consume any product related to the franchise, and won't let a Pokémon game go unplayed. These respondents are primarily around their twenties, and have to an extent grown up with Pokémon.

The \emph{Ingress} category are respondents who had previously played Ingress. Some active Ingress players were part of the Pokémon GO beta because of their participation, while others simply wanted to try another similar game. The \emph{Gamer} category are respondents who identify as gamers and picked up Pokémon GO because it was a new game, despite not having previous experience with either Pokémon or Ingress.

The \emph{Exercise} category are respondents who picked up the game as an exercise app, and wanted to use it as an excuse to walk more or a final push to get out and exercise, while the \emph{Fill outside time} are respondents who were already exercising or walking and wanted something to do during these activities.

The \emph{Children/family} category are respondents who either started playing because they wanted to spend time with their children or other family members who were already playing, or decided together with family members (significant others included) to start playing as a common activity. The \emph{Social} category are those who had similar goals with friends or who merely mentioned they started for the social aspect without specifying who they wished to be social with.

The \emph{Technology} category are respondents who were drawn to the game because of the technology used, be it augmented reality, GPS tracking or otherwise. The \emph{Real world} category are respondents who started playing because of the real world integration. They either wanted to find out what familiar locations had been turned into Pokéstops, or use the game to explore and find new and interesting locations. One subject in this category reported that they started playing because a sculpture they had made had been turned into a Pokéstop.

The \emph{Something to do} category are respondents who picked up the game just as something to do, either because they were bored at vacation or similar, or because they needed a distraction.

The \emph{Trends} category are respondents who started playing to take part in the cultural phenomenon and keep up with current trends.

\subsection{Analysis}

As expected, the Pokémon brand played a major role in spreading the game to such a vast number of players. 2164 respondents supplied a reason for downloading the game, and 1507 of them - almost 70 \% - listed \emph{Nostalgia or previous experience} as one of or the only reason they started playing. Releasing a Pokémon game that did not require any additional console (e.g. Nintendo DS) but could be played on the smartphone everyone was already carrying was all but guaranteed to be a success. However, not all games can be Pokémon games, so what other things did Pokémon GO do right that we can use to create other successful games? A little over 30 \% of the respondents did not list nostalgia as a reason, and while some of them may have had memories of watching or playing Pokémon but for some reason or other didn't pick this choice, there were certainly players who had no previous experience or connection with Pokémon.

The opportunity to get discounts or benefits because of Pokémon GO-related promotions did draw a few players, but with less than 0.5 \% of the respondents listing this as a reason, it seems negligible. Those who responded within the \emph{Pokémon} category can be grouped together with the nostalgia responders and should thus be ignored as well.

308 respondents, or just over 14 \%, said they were affected by official trailers or promotional material. This shows that the advertisements \todo{(were there more than the Super Bowl ad?)} were helpful in creating interest in the game. While 14 \% is a relatively small portion compared to the numbers for the other responses, the more casual players who were not reached by the survey (see more in section \ref{sec:problems-with-survey}) may have had a larger portion of players who were intrigued by the Super Bowl ad but who didn't have much previous experience with Pokémon. \todo{Insert picture from the Super Bowl ad here.}

During the first few weeks following the release of the game, there was quite extensive coverage of the game in media all over the world. A little under 15 \% of respondents said that this media coverage affected their decision to start playing Pokémon GO, meaning it was slightly more effective than the official promotional material at building the player base, despite not an insignificant number of the articles posted were negative in their view \todo{(add some citations for negative articles)}. However, the media would not have covered the phenomenon to such a degree had there not already been a huge player base, but if one can succeed in spreading the game to a large enough number of players such that the media starts covering the game, it is not unlikely that one can achieve a similar growth of an additional 15 \% players \todo{(does this argument make sense?)}. Those who responded within the \emph{Trends} category can also be included in this group.

A combined 69 \% of respondents said they started playing because of either recommendations from friends or family or from reading about the game on social media or internet forums. Similar to the \emph{Media coverage} group, these groups required someone else to pick up the game before them, but a huge following is not required for this to have an effect, unlike what is necessary for media coverage to kick in. Thus it could seem that if one can successfully spread ones game to an initial group of players and the game is appealing enough, it can easily spread naturally via them.

Veteran Ingress players were part of this initial group for Pokémon GO, and almost 11 \% of those who listed other reasons were previous Ingress players who either had been granted beta access to Pokémon GO or started playing it because they were previously familiar with the games from the developer. This also indicates that if a developer already has a successful game (even if somewhat niche, like Ingress), it is possible to adjust some parts of the game and release a new one and gain an initial player base from those familiar with your previous games. This is what game developers have been doing for years, and is also in line with \todo{Kiefer et al. (insert citation, "Systematically Exploring Design Space ...)}.

The \emph{Children/family} and \emph{Social} categories are partly related to the idea of creating an initial player base and letting it grow through sharing, but they also highlight the importance of the social aspect of the game. One area where Pokémon GO succeeded is making the game very social, and it becomes more fun to play together with others, as shown by 20 \% of the \emph{Other} responses placing in these categories. Players enjoyed going out to play with their friends and family, having a purpose and something to do while socializing. More on this in section \ref{sub:mental-health-social}. \todo{Add a note and citation for Coulton et al. (Harnessing Player Creativity ...) perhaps?}

The use of augmented reality technology and anchoring to the real world using GPS positioning also succeeded in attracting some number of players. About 7 \% of responses for the \emph{Other} option gave these areas as one of or the sole reason for playing. There still aren't a large number of games using these technologies, and being one of the few that do allowed Pokémon GO to grab a market share by filling a hole. Some examples of other games with relative success in these areas were mentioned in section \ref{sec:prestudy-ar-location-pervasive-games}, but there should still be room for more games in this category, and new, successful games could be created by changing some parameters of the Pokémon GO formula, as described in \todo{Kiefer et al. (ok with another citation of this only two paragraphs after the previous?)}.

Another category related to real world integration is \emph{Fill outside time}. The respondents in this category take advantage of the location-based aspect of the game, where the game progresses simply by moving around. They were looking for an activity to fill the time they were already spending outside, either walking somewhere (e.g. to work, public transit etc.) or exercising, and a game that doesn't require their constant attention and actually progresses based on the activity they were already performing is a better fit than most other mobile games.

Even though Pokémon GO isn't marketed as an exercise app, over 17 \% of respondents who chose the \emph{Other} option said they started playing the game with that exact purpose. The location-based gameplay serves as motivation to get up and out and to move around. With overweight being an increasing problem and sedentary lifestyles becoming increasingly common, we are frequently reminded by health institutions of the importance of physical activity. While most are aware that it is important to be physically active, many struggle with motivation. Not only being able to combine exercise with something fun, but the game actually requiring players to move around to progress makes Pokémon GO the perfect motivation for many players. Other games have also used a similar recipe to success before, as discussed in section \ref{sec:prestudy-ar-location-pervasive-games}. \todo{Is there any point in including this last sentence?}

The \emph{Something to do} and \emph{Gamer} categories can also be more or less ignored, because it is difficult \todo{(impossible?)} to say what will attract these players to your game over another one. The \emph{Gamer}s are likely to pick up any game they stumble upon, and the quality of the game will determine whether or not they will stick with the game. The respondents in the \emph{Something to do} category will similarly start any activity in an attempt to find something that can keep their attention. The best one can do to capture these players is to simply get the game as much exposure as possible to increase the odds of being the first activity or game they happen upon, and make sure the game is good enough to keep their attention. In the \emph{Miscellaneous} category are respondents whose reasons have too small of a sample size to draw any conclusions from.
