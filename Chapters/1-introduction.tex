\section{Research Questions and Method}

\todo{This section should list and explain the research questions in the GQM method frame.}

In any evaluation of software it is necessary to maintain metrics by which to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the software. In line with the GQM method \todo{(write more about the method and include reference)}, to evaluate Pokémon GO, the following three research goals have been defined:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are the main factors that made Pokémon GO successful?
	\item What are the effects on physical health from playing Pokémon GO, and how much effort does it take to achieve this effect?
	\item What are the effects on mental health from playing Pokémon GO?
\end{enumerate}

To evaluate these goals, a set of research questions was created for each of them.

\todo{List of research questions per goal}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are the main factors that made Pokémon GO successful?
	\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
		\item What factors most often influenced players to initially start playing Pokémon Go?
		\item What features of Pokémon Go were used the most?
		\item What features and aspects of Pokémon Go did players like compared to other similar games (location-based games/mobile games)
		\item What features and aspects of Pokémon Go did players like compared to previous games in the Pokémon franchise?
		\item What factors cause players to stop playing Pokémon Go?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item What are the effects on physical health from playing Pokémon GO, and how much effort does it take to achieve this effect?
	\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
		\item What portion of players increased their weekly physical activity due to playing, and what are the type of game-related activities that lead to increased activity?
		\item How much did players on average increase their weekly physical activity?
		\item How much have low-activity players increased their weekly physical activity compared to high-activity players?
		\item What portion of players have experienced weight loss or other health benefits, perceived or measured, and what benefits do they experience?
		\item What effect does playing Pokémon Go have on less healthy habits, such as drinking or eating fast food?
		\item What physical risks do players expose themselves and others to due to playing?
